                      <li>Working on the topic around sexual violence as a survivor
                          was personally very meaningful but on one side, retraumatizing.
                          At some point in the process, I completely stopped working
                          on the thesis, because I was too emotionally overwhelmed.</li>
                      <li>This topic is very personal and sensitive.  I hope I was
                          mindful and thoughtful enough to work on this topic and in the
                          process did no harm.</li>
                      <li>Like one of my interviewees said, there is no end of the 
                          recovery for survivors of sexual violence.  What we can do is
                          to learn to cope with what we have been through.  It is a slow
                          process, and everybody's pace is different.  I somehow feel
                          rushed my recovery to work on this issue.</li>

                  <ul>
                      <li>The level of intervention that I was looking at in the beginning of the project was the
                          macrosystem. I think it was going to be better if I was more mindful about the time frame
                          of this thesis project.</li>

                      <li>When asking questions to the public, questions should be easy to relate and simple. In my
                          brainstorming sessions, I wish I asked questions that are less complicated but closer to
                          individual's emotion and daily life.</li>

                      <li>Connecting with organizations is hard and it takes time. I would try to connect with
                          organizations earlier in the whole process if I do it again.</li>
