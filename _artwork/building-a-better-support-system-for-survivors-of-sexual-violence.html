                          At some point in the process, I completely stopped working

                          process did no harm.</li>

                          to learn to cope with what we have been through.  It is a slow
                          process, and everybody's pace is different.  I somehow feel
                          rushed my recovery to work on this issue.</li>

                          macrosystem. I think it was going to be better if I was more mindful about the time frame
                          of this thesis project.</li>

                      <li>When asking questions to the public, questions should be easy to relate and simple. In my
                          brainstorming sessions, I wish I asked questions that are less complicated but closer to
                          individual's emotion and daily life.</li>
