                  Sexual violence is an issue that has always been in the society but neglected to be talked
                  about openly in the public because of the sensitivity and complexity of its nature. Sexual
                  violence is not only a problem of people physically and mentally abusing others but
                  a problem that is rooted deeply in the culture and history of inequality, violence, and
                  dehumanization that puts individuals with such experience in high risks in various aspects
                  of their lives from remaining mental and physical health to fulfilling basic everyday needs.
                  2017 was an important year for this issue. By the help of the power of media, protests,
                  and campaigns, more conversations were opened up to the public, getting people ready
                  to listen to survivors' experience. However, there still seem to be lack of support system
                  for survivors of sexual violence that is understanding of individual's experiences and
                  situations that is sustainable and reliable.

                      painted onto red fabric, our stories are displayed in city and town centers to create and
                      demand public space to heal. The quilt resists the popular and narrow narrative of how
                      sexual violence occurs by telling many stories, not one. These stories have been displayed
                      30 times in 26 different cities and towns from Washington D.C. to White River, South
                      Dakota. The quilt builds a new culture where survivors are publicly supported, rather than
                      publicly shamed.

              <li>From my research I found that it is sometimes difficult to communicate with survivors.

                  Due to their trauma, sometimes it’s hard for them to remember the attack accurately.

                  How can you/ survivors’ friends/family help in such case?</li>

                  <ol>
                      <li>Helping individuals to naviagate their options better and support them to make

                          informed decisions is very important.</li>

                      <li>Being anonymous can make survivors feel safer because they can disclose their

                          information as much as they can.</li>

                      <li>Part of the reasons survivors reach out to the support organizations rather than

                      their friends and family is because the they might not know how to response to

                      the situation - Talking to a person who is trained can be more helpful to get the

                      right resources.</li>

                      <li>People around survivors saying the right things and asking right things can be

                          so powerful for survivors' healing process</li>

                      <li>Survivors might not want to report not only because of the shame, guilt and

                      complicated emotions but also because of limitations of time, language and

                      other responsibilities.</li>

                  <ol>
                      <li>It is important to create the space where people can figure out their own needs

                          and decide their own next steps.</li>

                      <li>Should be mindful not to take power and control away from survivors. This

                      happens often even with good intentions. People who try to help- shouldn't

                      assume what survivors need</li>

                      <li>Supporting someone can be difficult and emotionally exhausting. One should

                          know how to take of oneself to support others.</li>

                      <li>A lot of clients of Turnaround are not open to talk about their experience with
                          their friends and family.</li>

                      <li>The stage where you can talk about your experience with the close people can
                          be very far along in the healing journey.</li>

                      <li>Not everybody identifies themselves as "survivors." Should be mindful about
                      the language because the words you're using could force someone to be
                      someone they are not.</li>

                          was personally very meaningful but on one side, retraumatizing.
                          At some point in the process, I completely stopped working
                          on the thesis, because I was too emotionally overwhelmed.</li>

                          process did no harm.</li>

                          to learn to cope with what we have been through.  It is a slow
                          process, and everybody's pace is different.  I somehow feel
                          rushed my recovery to work on this issue.</li>

                          macrosystem. I think it was going to be better if I was more mindful about the time frame
                          of this thesis project.</li>

                      <li>When asking questions to the public, questions should be easy to relate and simple. In my
                          brainstorming sessions, I wish I asked questions that are less complicated but closer to
                          individual's emotion and daily life.</li>

                      <li>Connecting with organizations is hard and it takes time. I would try to connect with
                          organizations earlier in the whole process if I do it again.</li>
